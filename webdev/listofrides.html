						 SECURITY<br><br>
                            We are very strict with our security.
							We would implement a number of new security initiatives at Green Park including:
							Security teams using separate security and stewarding companies for the perimeter, arena, forest and even offsite security.
							Visible security presence on the perimeter and entrances from the park 
							and onwards, the security coordinators will oversee and manage all relevant companies and any operational activity.<br>
							Green Park have a pre-agreed eviction policy with the police in place.<br>
                            Please note at the entrance everyone will be required to pass through airport style metal detectors and undergo body
							and bag searches as a condition of entry. We reserve the right to refuse admittance to any person who refuses to be 
							searched by a steward or other person acting on their behalf. Please be advised that you may have to queue upon entry
							so we ask that you are patient. These plans are in place to ensure everyone has a safe and enjoyable time.

							STAYING GREEN<br><br>
							We hope you love Green Park as much as we do and want to help us keep it one of London's favourite green spaces.
							We are dedicated to reducing the environmental impact of the activities and need your help to make it happen.<br><br>
							
							Travel<br>
							It will be very convenient to travel with public trasport. this is because makes up ¾ of the total carbon emissions 
							generated to our environment.<br><br>
							
							Waste<br>
							At the site, there are alot of bins all around the place. Each bin is been divided into three
							sections to help with recycling and compositing. There is a section for all glass, which would be needed for glass bottles.
							Then the one for cans, the one for plastic and the one for paper. There are also compost bins, here food scraps and leftovers
							can be thrown.<br>
							*Please watch the type of bin before dumping. <br><br> 
							
							 BIN YOUR BUTTS<br>
							 Every butt has to be picked up by hand, so it would be awesome if you did not flick your cigarette.<br><br>

							 WATER<br>
							 Water is free. Please feel free to refill your water bottle at the taps provided.
